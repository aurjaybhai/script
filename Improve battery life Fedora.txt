Improve battery life
Fedora is optimized more for desktops than laptops, so it might not offer the best battery life by default. 

So itâ€™s recommended to adjust the power setting to optimize the battery life on laptops by installing the advanced power management tool TLP.  Run the below commands to setup TLP:

sudo dnf5 install tlp
sudo systemctl enable tlp
sudo systemctl start tlp
