Below is the exact, line-by-line explanation of every package the other user told you to install on a fresh Ubuntu.  
I keep the ones that are genuinely useful and **remove the ones that are either redundant, obsolete, or simply not needed on a modern, up-to-date Ubuntu**.  
After each package I tell you:

• **What it is / why it exists**  
• **Do you actually need it on Ubuntu 22.04+?**  
• **Keep, drop, or replace with something better**

### Core system helpers
| Package | Explanation | Keep / Drop / Replace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sudo` | Lets ordinary users run commands as root. Ubuntu already ships it. | **Keep** (already installed). |
| `curl` | Command-line tool for downloading files or talking to APIs. | **Keep** – ubiquitous in dev workflows. |
| `wget` | Another downloader. | **Drop** – `curl` can do everything `wget` does; having both is harmless but pointless. |
| `git` | Distributed version control. | **Keep** – essential. |
| `vim` | Traditional terminal editor. | **Keep** if you like vim; otherwise Ubuntu already ships `nano`. Purely personal. |
| `nano` | Simpler terminal editor. | Already installed, no need to re-install. |
| `build-essential` | Meta-package that pulls in `gcc`, `g++`, `make`, headers, etc. | **Keep** – baseline for compiling C/C++. |
| `software-properties-common` | Gives you `add-apt-repository` so you can add PPAs from the CLI. | **Keep** – handy. |
| `apt-transport-https` | Lets `apt` fetch packages over HTTPS. | **Drop** – built into `apt` since Ubuntu 18.04; package is now empty. |
| `ca-certificates` | SSL/TLS root certificates. | **Keep** – already installed, but critical. |

### Compression / archive tools
| Package | Explanation | Keep / Drop / Replace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `zip` `unzip` | Create / extract traditional `.zip` files. | **Keep** – small and useful. |
| `rar` `unrar` | Handle `.rar` archives. | **Drop** – `unrar-free` in the Ubuntu repos can extract. Proprietary `rar` encoder rarely needed. |
| `p7zip-full` `p7zip-rar` | 7-Zip archiver + RAR plugin. | **Keep** – `p7zip-full` alone can create/extract 7z, xz, tar, etc. `p7zip-rar` adds *write* support for RAR; drop it unless you **create** RARs. |
| `tar` | Already part of Ubuntu base. | Nothing to install. |

---

### Network / remote tools
| Package | Explanation | Keep / Drop / Replace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `openssh-server` | Runs an SSH daemon so you can log in remotely. | **Keep only if you want remote SSH access**; otherwise disable or don’t install. |
| `net-tools` | Legacy tools like `ifconfig`. | **Drop** – superseded by `iproute2` (`ip` command). Install `iproute2` if it’s missing (it isn’t). |

---

### Language runtimes & tooling
| Package | Explanation | Keep / Drop / Replace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `python3-pip` | Python package manager. | **Keep** – required to install PyPI packages (Jupyter, etc.). |
| `python3-venv` | Built-in venv support. | **Keep** – lets you create isolated Python environments. |
| `nodejs` `npm` | JavaScript runtime and package manager. | **Keep** if you do any JS/TS work; otherwise skip. |
| `default-jre` | Default Java runtime (OpenJDK). | **Keep** only if some tool you install later needs JRE (e.g., Android SDK). Otherwise defer. |
| `openjdk-17-jdk` | Full Java compiler + runtime. | **Keep** if you plan to write Java or build Android apps; otherwise drop. |
| `golang-go` | Go compiler from Ubuntu repo. | **Replace** with the official tarball or use `golang snap` to get latest stable. Ubuntu’s package lags behind. |
| `rustc` `cargo` | Rust compiler & package manager. | **Replace** with `rustup` – the official installer keeps you on the latest stable/beta/nightly. Ubuntu repo is usually 1-2 releases behind. |

### Databases
| Package | Explanation | Keep / Drop / Replace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `postgresql` `postgresql-contrib` | PostgreSQL server + extra extensions. | **Keep** only if you genuinely need a local Postgres server. Otherwise install client (`postgresql-client`) only. |
| `mysql-server` | MySQL server. | **Keep** only if you need a local MySQL server. Otherwise install client (`mysql-client`) only. Don’t install both Postgres and MySQL unless you really need both. |
| `redis-server` | In-memory key/value store. | **Keep** only if you develop with Redis. |

---

### Container / cloud tooling
| Package | Explanation | Keep / Drop / Replace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docker.io` | Docker engine (Ubuntu’s build). | **Replace** with Docker’s official repo package (`docker-ce`) – faster updates, better support. |
| `docker-compose` | Stand-alone v1 binary. | **Drop** – v1 is EOL. Install `docker-compose-plugin` (v2) via Docker’s repo. |
| `kubectl` | Kubernetes CLI. | **Keep** only if you interact with K8s clusters. |
| `awscli` | Amazon AWS CLI v1. | **Replace** with `awscli v2` via official installer (Snap or tarball). Ubuntu repo only has v1. |

### Snap packages the user mentioned
| Package | Explanation | Keep / Drop / Replace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `code --classic` | VS Code. | **Keep** – official, up-to-date. |
| `postman` | REST client. | **Keep** if you test APIs; otherwise skip. |

---

### Misc utilities
| Package | Explanation | Keep / Drop / Replace |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tree` | Prints directory trees in CLI. | **Keep** – tiny and handy. |
| `htop` | Interactive process viewer. | **Keep** – nicer than plain `top`. |
| `gnome-tweaks` | GUI to change GNOME settings. | **Keep** if you use GNOME. |
| `vlc` | Media player. | **Keep** – convenient, but unrelated to dev work. |
| `gimp` | Image editor. | **Keep** if you do graphics; otherwise skip. |
| `chromium-browser` | Open-source Chrome. | **Keep** if you want a second browser; otherwise skip. |
